# ninja-qf

This is the neovim side of things, meant to go with a version of [Ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja) that spits compile errors at vim through RPC.

Note: Ninja of course doesn't do this by default. I have a hacked version that uses [rpclib](https://github.com/rpclib/rpclib), but it isn't ready for public eyes yet.
